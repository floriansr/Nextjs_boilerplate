### STARTER NextJS-TS-Jest-UI

If you have difficulties with types atm, you can disable strict mode (tsconfig.json).

## Getting Started

```
yarn all
```

This command will installs dependencies, build env, checks types and coverage, launches eslint, formats with prettier, tests with jest and finally launches the server on localhost:3000.
