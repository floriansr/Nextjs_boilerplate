### STARTER NextJS-TS-Jest-UI

Inspired by these repos [here](https://github.com/Liinkiing/next-ts-starter) && [here] (https://github.com/layshidani/react-avancado-boilerplate)

If you have difficulties with types atm, you can disable strict mode (tsconfig.json).

### Getting Started

```
yarn all
```

This command will installs the dependencies, build, checks the typing & coverage, launches eslint, formats with prettier, tests with jest and finally launches the server.
